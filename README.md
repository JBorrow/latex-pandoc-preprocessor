Latex to Markdown Preprocessor
==============================

Annoyed that Pandoc doesn't correctly handle figure labels? Well, this module
is just for you!

```ltmd``` uses regex to extract figures, references, and mathematics, and 
processes them separately to Pandoc so that the figure references, etc. are
preserved.

See the test file for usage.
